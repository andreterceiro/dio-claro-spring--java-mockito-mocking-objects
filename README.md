# General

First of all, I created the project:

- With Maven (`~/bin/mvn-ask-parameters`);
- I already solved the problem with Java version (please see [this repository](https://github.com/andreterceiro/dio-java-mockito-initial));
- From [https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central] MVN Reposiory I installed two Mockito dependencies:
  - Mockito Core
  - Mockito JUnit Jupiter

Without annotations, the teacher showed other way to use Mockito:
